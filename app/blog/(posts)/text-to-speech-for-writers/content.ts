  {
    "q": "Does listening replace a copyeditor?",
    "a": "No. It offers another way to inspect the draft. It does not check facts, plot, logic or style for you, and audio can miss mechanical errors."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the best proofreading speed?",
    "a": "There is no universal multiplier in this guide. Start comfortably, repeat difficult passages and change the pace according to the task."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I annotate without Premium?",
    "a": "Yes. Notes and highlights are free in LoudReader. Playback speed and other features have separate Premium gates."
  },
  {
    "q": "Will an exported manuscript update as I edit?",
    "a": "No automatic editor integration is claimed. Keep changes in the source and re-export for the next listening copy."
