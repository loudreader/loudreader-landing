  {
    "q": "Can I use the app without holding my phone?",
    "a": "On iPhone, background playback can continue with the screen locked. Test the controls on your speaker or headphones before your hands are occupied."
  },
  {
    "q": "Will a speaker solve all kitchen noise?",
    "a": "No. An extractor, blender or running water can still mask speech. Pause rather than relying on higher volume."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can the sleep timer replace my oven timer?",
    "a": "No. Keep a separate cooking timer. The app’s sleep timer controls listening and is a Premium feature."

    "q": "Is LoudReader a native Mac app?",
    "a": "No. It is an iPhone and iPad app; compatible Apple Silicon Macs run the iPad build."
