  {
    "q": "Why do I abandon books?",
    "a": "There is no single explanation. Time, interest, difficulty and interruptions all matter. Look at the particular book before deciding what to change."
  },
  {
    "q": "Will switching to audio make me finish?",
    "a": "It may help if it fits your routine or the material better. It cannot guarantee interest, attention or completion."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does the sleep timer save the point where I fell asleep?",
    "a": "No. It stops playback after the selected interval; it cannot detect which words you heard. Check your place when you return."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is it okay to stop a book?",
    "a": "For leisure reading, yes. For required reading, consider the actual requirement and make a plan for the sections you need."
